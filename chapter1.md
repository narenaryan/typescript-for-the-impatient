# Types 

We all know that Java Script has only one type called <b>var</b>. All other variables which are not declared as <b>var</b> are of global scope. One more interesting thing is JavaScript has function scope whereas other traditional languages has block scope. Now we are going to see the rich set of types available in Type Script. There are three main types in TypeScript.

* number
* string
* boolean

All the values which TypeScript process will fall under one of these three types. Let us see few examples of these.

```
var name: string = "Naren";
var age: number = 24;
var score: number = 8.3;
var isMarried: boolean = false;

```
If we see the above statements a variable declaration in TypeScript is happening using types attached after the variable declaration.
